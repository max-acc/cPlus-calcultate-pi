# <p align="center"><b>Calculate Pi</b></p>

There are lot of possibilities on how to calculate the circle number &pi;:

* [Continued Fraction](#approximation)
* [Continued Fraction](#continued-fraction)


## Approximation
### Approximation after Archimedes
Archimedes was one of the first who tried to calculate Pi with approximation. He tried it with regular polygons and increased the number of corners to calculate an upper and lower limit for what Pi can be.  
He calculated until the corner number 96 and came to the conclusion that Pi has to be lower than 3+(10/70) and higher than 3+(10/71)
